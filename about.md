i think... my name is christian.

i think... i work as a developer in an agile team at [xpeppers](http://xpeppers.com/) in trento, italy.

i think... i like web development and [open source](https://github.com/christian-fei).

i think... i'm way into simple and stupid things.

i think... i swear a lot.
