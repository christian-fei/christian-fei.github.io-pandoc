        I like to build digital products that meet the customers' needs.
        My objective is to continuously improve since I believe in this field you never stop learning.
    </p>

    <p>
        In my work experience in XPeppers since 2014 I adopted essential practices to write maintainable software and work effectively with my team, collaborate with the customer in a lean and modern way.
        During the past few years I expanded my knowledge with methodologies, techniques and programming languages, at work and in my spare time.
    </p>

    <p>
        My main programming language is JavaScript & Node.js, Elixir and a bit of Ruby (on Rails). I had the opportunity to work with Java and PHP too.
        I am experimenting with Haskell, Scala and Elm.
    </p>
    <p>
        I try to focus more on concepts and practices than on the technology or programming languages. I say this because I think great software is created first  with a solid foundation of practices to reduce stress that enable you to maintain the software like tests, code refactoring, continuous integration, clean code.
    </p>
    <p>
        In my opinion good software development is about people, so I embrace and truly believe it's essential to have a tight collaboration and effective communication between the team and the customer.
