<p>
My objective is to <i>continuously improve</i> since I believe in this field you <i>never stop learning</i>.
</p>
<p>
  During the past few years I expanded my knowledge with <i>methodologies</i>, <i>techniques</i> and <i>programming languages</i>, at work and in my spare time.
</p>
<p>
  In my work experience in <strong>XPeppers</strong> since <i>2014</i> I adopted essential practices to write <strong>maintainable software</strong> and work effectively with my <strong>team</strong>, <i>collaborate</i> with the <strong>customer</strong> in a <i>lean</i> and modern way.
</p>
<p>
  My main programming language is <strong>JavaScript</strong> &amp; <strong>Node.js</strong>, <strong>Elixir</strong> and of <strong>Ruby (on Rails)</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  My frameworks/libraries/services/technologies of choice in which I feel fluent writing web applications are:

  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://expressjs.com" target="_blank">Express 4</a> (Node.js Backend)</li>
    <li><a href="https://angular.io" target="_blank">Angular (1 &amp; 2)</a> (JavaScript Frontend)</li>
    <li><a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/" target="_blank">React</a> (JavaScript Frontend)</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/elixir-lang/plug" target="_blank">Plug</a> (Elixir Backend)</li>
    <li><a href="https://vuejs.org" target="_blank">Vue.js</a> (JavaScript Frontend)</li>
    <li><a href="http://rubyonrails.org" target="_blank">Rails</a> (Ruby Backend)</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.docker.com" target="_blank">Docker</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.ansible.com" target="_blank">Ansible</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com" target="_blank">AWS</a> (EC2, S3, API Gateway, Cloudwatch, Lambda, SES, SNS, IAM)</li>
  </ul>

  I had the opportunity to work with Java and PHP too.
  <br>
  I am experimenting with Haskell and Elm, to sooth my <a href="/posts/Functional-JavaScript-write-your-negate-not-function/">functional pleasures</a>.
</p>

<h2>The way I work</h2>

<p>
  I try to focus more on concepts and practices than on the technology or programming languages.
  <br>
  I say this because I think great software is created first  with a solid foundation of practices to reduce stress that enable you to maintain the software like tests, code refactoring, continuous integration, clean code.
</p>
<p>
  In my opinion good software development is about people, so I embrace and truly believe it's essential to have a tight collaboration and effective communication between the team and the customer.
</p>
<p>
  I work with TDD. Refactoring, Continuous Integration, Provisioning and Automatic Deploys are essential to me.
</p>
<p>
  I want to work in a constructive, concentrated environment, where professionalism is demanded, and it's where I am able to solve business problems in an agile way.
</p>
<p>
  I seek to work in a healthy work environment with people from which I can learn from and share knowledge.
