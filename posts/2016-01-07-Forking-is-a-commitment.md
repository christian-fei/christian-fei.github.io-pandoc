How many times did you see forks lying around on github?

How often did you notice the annoying message "This branch is X commits behind awesome-project:master."?

Why did you fork it in the first place?

Was it an animal instinct of yours to click on a shiny button?

A great man once said:

What I am trying to get across is that forking a repository just to have it lying around is a waste of everyone's time
and attention.

Like branches should be short-lived, forks should be made with a commitment and small improvements pushed upstream.
