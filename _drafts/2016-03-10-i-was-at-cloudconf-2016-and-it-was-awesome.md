Today I had the opportunity to attend the fourth edition of [cloudconf](http://2016.cloudconf.it/)!
It's an european event on scalability and cloud development, with excellent speakers
that share their experiences and use-cases ranging from shopify, stackoverflow, google,
docker, microsoft and many more.

I particularly liked the following talks:

### "RISE OF THE MACHINES: AUTOMATE YOUR DEVELOPMENT"

Sven Peters, an Evangelist at Atlassian, shared with us how the company invested their time
to automate everyday operations that seemed necessary to do manually, to bots.

They have built, shared with the world and use internally report bots, chat bots, ci bots, deploy bots,
code bots, and many more.

Some of the most interesting ones are:

- dr. code analyses code and if you get caught doing something nasty (like skipping a test, writing junit3 tests) you'll enter the wall of shame
- a bot that creates release notes based on the commit history.
