Recently I found myself struggling in a legacy project with this question:

> When do you know you found the right tradeoff between delivering value to the customer and sanitizing the codebase?

From my point of view, as soon as you are not confident anymore on the things you could've broken with a small change, that's the moment when you have to invest time in covering the desired part in tests and start refactoring.

This can be very tedious and steal lots of valuable time to the business.

There is no excuse or higher priority than that. Business requirements should not dictate priorities in this case. Of course you have to do the least amount of work needed to make you confident and don't waste time to polish other parts of the system. And that's where the pitfall is.

Once you start, it's difficult to stop. But you have to.
