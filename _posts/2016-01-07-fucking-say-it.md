it's definitely not easy. and absolutely nobody forces you to do so.

but here's what i think: if you read/see/hear/feel something outrageous/excessively negative/stupid/wrong,
just fucking tell them already. stop being fucking politically correct.

being fucking politically correct can oftentimes make "the situation" more pleasant for everyone.
only sometimes should you seek for that level of perfection.
