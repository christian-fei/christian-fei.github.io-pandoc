it is definitely tempting to be longing for too much when you are feeling good.

but you need to take control over your actions and stop wanting/pretending too much.

you will probably end losing people you cared about. and for what? for the next hit?

enjoy the moment and don't longe for too much.

i'm not saying you shouldn't take risks though.
