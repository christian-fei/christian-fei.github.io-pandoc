living with *less* expectations day by day is one of the best things i have ever 
done in my life.

i was way too concerned about what will happen in a certain situation, hoping some
things would end up as i expected, etc.

when it didn't i felt like shit.

when i didn't think about it at all and let things happen, statistically speaking 
it went way better than i would ever have expected (you see what i did there?!).
