![scapegoat](http://www.silverbearcafe.com/private/04.11/images/scapegoat.jpg)

fuck them.

fuck them when you see a sign of egoism, possibly multiple times.

fuck them when you genuinely show interest in others and affection,
but as a response they shit in your face.

fuck them when you try to cheer them up but every attempt fails with
a cold-hearted response and they don't reciprocate your interest.

fuck them when they cannot tell you the truth or simply be sincere with you
because they *don't have enough time* to tell you that. this of course because
they have to concentrate on themselves.

fuck them when you spend lots of time and thought on a person you really care
about and they seem too at first, but finally you realize they have some serious
issues with themselves and they used you as a scapegoat.
