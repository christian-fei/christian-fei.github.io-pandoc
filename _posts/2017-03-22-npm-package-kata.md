Today at work, during the **"Pomodoro study time"** (a pomodoro of free study time during work),
 we did something cool.

We created an **npm package** during this **kata**, with [**tests**](https://github.com/AlessioCoser/npm-package-kata/tree/master/test), a [**green CI build**](https://travis-ci.org/AlessioCoser/npm-package-kata) and an actual [**package on npm** ](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-package-kata) in **25 minutes**!

Check out the [repository](https://github.com/AlessioCoser/npm-package-kata) where we commited the code and the [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-package-kata)!
