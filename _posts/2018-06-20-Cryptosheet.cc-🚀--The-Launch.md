Today, after months of work, I'm proud to announce the official launch of [cryptosheet.cc](https://cryptosheet.cc)!

It is built for a need of mine: **keeping track of transactions and account balances for your crypto assets.**

## Problem? Solved!

Cryptosheet now satisfies my need to have all the information of my cryptocurrency transactions on a regular [Google Sheet](http://sheets.google.com/).

Here is an example:

## Spreadsheets are dead. Long live spreadsheets!

And since we are talking about Spreadsheets now: you can use `ARRAYFORMULA`, `FILTER`, `IMPORTRANGE`, `SUMIF` and really an infinite amount of ways of combining the raw data with visualizations, charts and breakdowns!

## Get on board! ðŸš¢

[Signup now](https://cryptosheet.cc) for an easy-peasy way for keeping track of your crypto assets!
