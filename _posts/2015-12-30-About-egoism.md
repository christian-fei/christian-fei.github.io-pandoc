fuck them.

fuck them when you see a sign of egoism, possibly multiple times.

fuck them when you genuinely show interest in others and affection,
but as a response they shit in your face.

fuck them when you try to cheer them up but every attempt fails with
 a cold-hearted response and they don't reciprocate your interest.

fuck them when you spend lots of time and thought on a person you really care
about and they seem too at first, but finally you realize they have some serious
issues with themselves and they used you as a scapegoat.
