Today I attended an event about ["Blockchain for Smart Communities"](https://www.smartcityweek.it/event/la-blockchain-per-le-smart-communities/) during the [Trento Smart City Week](https://www.smartcityweek.it/).

The topics discussed are:

- the impact on citizens, businessed &amp; public administration
- new opportunities offered by blockchain technology and smart contracts
- use cases like automating insurances, providing transparency and resilience on administrative tasks and much more

```
- community is necessary to empower blockchain
- trust is essential
- as a member of a blockchain, you *participate* to the community (p2p)
-> resilience, distributed systems + infrastructure

PANTA REI (everything flows)

- like internet in 1993, blockchain in 2018
- Trentino = "Bitcoin Valley"
- Bitcoin as cultura, economic & tech innovation
- can be seen as an insurance, to get back the freedom and security
  for deciding autonomously where to put our money and assets
- insurances are inefficient
  - manual
  - identity needs to be verified over and over again
  - human error
  - centralized
- public administration can benefit from blockchain
- infrastructure thinks and decides in a neutral way
- think of gas counters, they are already small embedded devices
  that apply rules about consumption & cost autonomously, but without being transparent
```
