I'm reading everyday something about Angular and lately I've been into styleguides in particular to make more opinionated decisions when crafting [pomodoro.cc](https://pomodoro.cc/) and to learn and improve my Angular skills.

This list will be updated with new content and treated as a bookmark folder of mine of Angular styleguides.
